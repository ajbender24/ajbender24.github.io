        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>My name is Aidan Bender, and I am from Wrentham, Massachusetts. I am currently a Senior at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am an English major concentrating in the Study and Practice of Writing, and I am also a Political Science minor. I am a member of the Pre-Law Club, the Club Lacrosse team, and the Ski and Snowboard club here at school.</p>

        <p>I am a self-starting, hardworking person who possesses great interpersonal skills. I have demonstrated these skills in the different jobs I have had throughout my life, especially over the last two years. This past summer, I was a sales intern for the Boston Beer Company. This required me to understand the interpersonal skillset associated with a sales role, as well as maintain relationships with the multiple new accounts I was able to obtain for the company. I was also an intern with the Worcester County District Attorneyâ€™s Office in Summer 2021 and Spring 2022. This position taught me about the various responsibilities of employees within every department of the office, and I also contributed regularly to weekly group meetings with different members of the office. </p>

        <p>The courses I have taken in college, specifically Legal Studies and Political Science courses, have required me to do extensive legal research, so I will be confident and familiar with this anytime it is required of me in the future. The English courses I have taken in college have allowed me to improve my writing skills greatly and have also taught me project completion skills and the importance of strong attention to detail. </p>

        <p>Next year, I am planning on attending law school. I would like to focus on either criminal law or family law while in law school and after recieving my JD. I will be activitly looking for internships and opportunities while continuing in law school over the next three years. Should you like to reach out to me, I can be reached at abender@umass.edu through email. Thank you! </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>Some of my interests outside of school include playing lacrosse and skiing as mentioned previously. I have done both since I was very young. I also enjoy hikes, going for runs, and pretty much any outdoor activity in general. I am also a big fan of the four major Boston sports teams. </p>
