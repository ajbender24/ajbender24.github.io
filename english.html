        This is a mock grant proposal that I wrote for my English 379 class in the fall of 2022. We were required to choose a non-profit organization and create a plan that would help them achieve their goals. We were then required to write to a charitable organization on behalf of the non-profit and request funds for our plan. </p>
        <p> <a class="button" href="english350h1.pdf"> English 350H Essay 1 (Fall 2022) (PDF) </a> <br>
        This is an essay I wrote for my English 350H class in the fall of 2022. In this essay, I combined documentary style writing with personal reflection. I analyzed the legalization of gambling in different states throughout the country and what the consequences of this will be in the future. I tied this in with some personal experiences involving gambling, especially those relate to family members. </p>
